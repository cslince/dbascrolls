Certainly! To add a query ID to the code, you would first need a way to generate unique IDs for each query. Since SQL Server does not have a built-in query ID system, you would need to implement your own. One way to do this is by using a combination of the database ID (dbid), object ID (objectid), and execution count.

Here's an example of how you can modify your query to include a query ID:

```sql
SELECT
    qs_cpu.total_worker_time / 1000 AS total_cpu_time_ms,
    CONCAT(q.dbid, '_', q.objectid, '_', qs_cpu.execution_count) AS query_id,
    q.[text],
    p.query_plan,
    qs_cpu.execution_count,
    q.dbid,
    q.objectid,
    q.encrypted AS text_encrypted
FROM
    (SELECT TOP 500 qs.plan_handle,
     qs.total_worker_time,
     qs.execution_count FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs ORDER BY qs.total_worker_time DESC) AS qs_cpu
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(plan_handle) AS q
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_query_plan(plan_handle) p
WHERE p.query_plan.exist('declare namespace 
        qplan = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/07/showplan";
        //qplan:MissingIndexes')=1
```

In this modified code, I've added a `CONCAT` function to generate a unique query ID using the `dbid`, `objectid`, and `execution_count`. This should help identify each query uniquely. Keep in mind that this method assumes that the combination of these three values will be unique for each query in your database. If this assumption doesn't hold, you may need to implement a more sophisticated query ID generation logic.
